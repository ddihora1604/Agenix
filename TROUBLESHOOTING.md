# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues that may occur when using the Marketing AI Agents Workflow application, particularly with the markdown display feature.

## Markdown Files Not Displaying

If the workflow results section shows "Processing..." but doesn't display any content:

### Check Output Directory Structure

1. Verify that the output directory exists:
   ```
   /marketing_ai/marketing_ai/output/
   ```

2. If the directory doesn't exist, create it:
   ```
   mkdir -p marketing_ai/marketing_ai/output
   ```

### Generate Sample Markdown Files

1. Run the sample file generation script:
   ```
   node scripts/create-sample-markdown.js
   ```

2. Verify that the files were created in the output directory:
   ```
   dir marketing_ai/marketing_ai/output
   ```

   You should see the following files:
   - competitor_analysis.md
   - product_recommendations.md
   - trend_identification.md
   - content_creation.md
   - sales_enablement.md

### Check Console for Errors

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any error messages related to API calls or file access
4. Common errors include:
   - 404 Not Found: The markdown file doesn't exist
   - 500 Internal Server Error: Issue with reading or processing the file

### Verify API Endpoints

Test the markdown API endpoint directly in your browser or using curl:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/api/markdown?agentId=competitor_analysis
```

If this returns a 404 error, the file doesn't exist. If it returns a 200 with content, then the issue is with the frontend display.

## "Processing" State Persists

If agents remain in the "Processing" state indefinitely:

1. Check that the polling mechanism is working:
   - Look for "Checking for markdown files..." messages in the console
   - Verify that the agents are configured with the correct backend IDs

2. Try manually refreshing the page and re-running the workflow

3. If using Windows, ensure file paths are formatted correctly with backslashes in the appropriate places

## File Content Not Updating

If you've updated a markdown file but the content in the UI doesn't reflect the changes:

1. Make sure the workflow is still in the "running" state
2. Check that the polling interval is working (log messages in console)
3. Try clicking on a different agent tab and then back to the one you're interested in
4. If all else fails, restart the workflow execution

## Markdown Formatting Issues

If the markdown content displays but the formatting is incorrect:

1. Check the markdown file's content directly to ensure it has proper formatting
2. Verify that the `processMarkdownContent` function in `api/markdown/route.ts` is correctly processing the content
3. Ensure your markdown adheres to standard markdown syntax

## Path Resolution Problems

If you encounter path resolution issues:

1. Check that the path construction in the API routes is correct for your operating system
2. For Windows systems, ensure paths use the correct format:
   ```javascript
   const outputDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '..', 'marketing_ai', 'marketing_ai', 'output');
   ```

3. Verify the current working directory with:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Current working directory:', process.cwd());
   ```

## Backend Connection Issues

If the frontend isn't properly connecting to the backend:

1. Make sure the file structure follows the expected pattern:
   ```
   /AgenticAI
     /NANgry_birds
     /marketing_ai
       /marketing_ai
         /output
   ```

2. Check network requests in the browser's Network tab to see if API calls are being made correctly

## Resolving Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Output Directory

**Symptoms**: All agents show "Processing..." indefinitely
**Solution**: Run the sample markdown generation script:
```
node scripts/create-sample-markdown.js
```

### Scenario 2: Missing Trend Identification File

**Symptoms**: Only the Trend Analyst agent shows "Processing..."
**Solution**: Create the missing file:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const dir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'marketing_ai', 'marketing_ai', 'output');
const file = path.join(dir, 'trend_identification.md');
fs.writeFileSync(file, '# Market Trend Analysis\n\nThis is sample content.');
```

### Scenario 3: API Returns 404

**Symptoms**: Console shows 404 errors when polling for markdown files
**Solution**: Check that the filenames in the API routes match the actual files:
```javascript
// In api/markdown/route.ts
const fileMapping = {
  'competitor_analysis': 'competitor_analysis.md',
  'product_recommendations': 'product_recommendations.md',
  'trend_identification': 'trend_identification.md',
  'content_creation': 'content_creation.md',
  'sales_enablement': 'sales_enablement.md'
};
```
