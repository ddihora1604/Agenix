## Markdown Display Feature

The application automatically displays markdown (.md) files generated by the marketing AI agents. See [Markdown Display Feature Documentation](./MARKDOWN_DISPLAY_FEATURE.md) for more details on this functionality.

## Backend Integration

The marketing agents are powered by a Python backend located in the `marketing_ai` directory. The backend uses:

- **CrewAI**: For agent orchestration and workflow management
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to language models for AI-powered processing
- **Sequential Processing**: Executes agents in the specific order defined by the user
- **Output Generation**: Creates markdown files in the `marketing_ai/output` directory

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python, CrewAI
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind
