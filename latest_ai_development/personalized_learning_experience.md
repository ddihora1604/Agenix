* **Module 2 Lab:** Guided lab sessions for building and evaluating linear regression models.

* **Module 2 Quiz:** Evaluates understanding and application of linear regression.

* **Module 3: Logistic Regression:** Covers binary and multinomial logistic regression, model interpretation, and evaluation metrics. Includes hands-on exercises in Python.

* **Module 3 Lab:** Guided lab sessions for building and evaluating logistic regression models.  Includes challenges for applying learned concepts.

* **Module 3 Quiz:** Evaluates understanding and application of logistic regression.

* **Module 4: Model Evaluation and Selection:** Covers model evaluation metrics, cross-validation techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection strategies.

* **Module 4 Project:**  Students apply learned concepts to a real-world dataset, building and evaluating multiple models and presenting findings.

* **Module 4 Peer Review:**  Peer review of student projects.

* **Module 4 Instructor Review:** Instructor review of student projects.

* **Final Exam:** Comprehensive exam covering all modules.

* **Discussion Forums:** Online forums for student interaction and collaboration.

* **Supplemental Resources:** Links to external resources, including research papers, online tutorials, and datasets.

**IV. Unified Narrative:**

This course follows a "data detective" theme, where students act as data detectives investigating a real-world problem. Each module represents a stage in this investigation:

* **Module 1:**  Introduces the "case" – the real-world problem to be solved.
* **Module 2 & 3:** Students gather clues by learning regression and classification techniques.
* **Module 4:** Students evaluate evidence and select the best model.
* **Project:** Students reconstruct the crime scene, presenting their findings.
* **Final Exam:** Tests the student’s ability to solve the case.


**V. Integration Points:**

The narrative connects all components, providing context and purpose for each learning activity.  The assignments progressively build upon each other, reinforcing concepts and developing skills.  The project integrates all learned concepts, allowing students to apply their knowledge in a practical setting.  The discussion forums provide a platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

This integrated learning experience aims to create an engaging and effective learning environment, fostering a deeper understanding of machine learning fundamentals and preparing students for success in the field.
